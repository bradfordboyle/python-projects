speed
=====

Small python script to
    1. read in GPX files
    2. extract speed and elevation data
    3. smooth the data with a 2nd-order Butterworth filter
    4. create data file/plot script

Usage: ./speed.py <gpx-file>

When I do longer bike rides, I like to track my ride with GPS device that
records that route I took. By downloading these route files, I can produce
plots of my rides. Examples of plots generate with this script can be seen
here:
